There are 3 methods

1. Symmetrical Encryption

   Uses the same key for encryption and decrytion, so both parties possess the key which can be a security problem
   So the exchange is done via a key exchange algorithm. KEA => the key is generated by the 2 entities
1. Asymmetrical Encryption

   Uses 2 diff√©rent keys : public and private keys
   The public keys are shared but the private key must be kept secret
