Learning purposes

ssh
On a linux os :
install git : if git is not present 

```
sudo apt-get install git
```
You ca install npm on linux
```
sudo apt-get install npm
```
and then install node 
```
npm install npm
```

To log in without ssh keys :

in putty, enter the ip adress and start a new session
login : root
password : it has been sent by mail by the provider
at your first attempt, the host asks you to change it to your special secret password : type the original and then the new password
you are in

There are 3 methods

1. Symmetrical Encryption
   Uses the same key for encryption and decrytion, so both parties possess the key which can be a security problem so the exchange is done via a key exchange algorithm. KEA => the key is generated by the 2 entities
1. Asymmetrical Encryption
   Uses 2 diff√©rent keys : public and private keys The public keys are shared but the private key must be kept secret
   the method uses a key excahnge algo ( the diffie hellman key exchange) once this is done, the server sends a challenge to the client which, by resolving it, shows it has the private key Most of the time, the key exchange process is made with asymmetrical encryption but because it is time consuming, the rest of the "chat" is made using symmetrical enc.
1. Hashing
   Hashing is not meant to decrypt anything : the commands sent are encrypted to fixed length chunks that can never be decrypted again because (a a workmate once told me) the process alters the original in a way that it could if it were decrypted could correspond to    many many possible originals.
   it is used to verify that the messages exchanged are not modified by a third party (hashmaps) the message is sent thru ssh alonside a hash map (MAC) so the server by hashing the message can can compare the result with the hash map sent by the client ! the host has the same symmetric key, the package secret number and the MAC.
